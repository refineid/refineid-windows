//! One flow for every signature format the CLI offers.
//!
//! The four format modules each expose the same two-phase shape --
//! build, sign, assemble -- because the key is behind a PIN. Each also
//! wants that shape spelled slightly differently: `PAdES` reserves a
//! hole and patches it, `ASiC` writes an archive, `CAdES` returns a
//! structure. A caller that supports all of them would otherwise carry
//! a five-way match at every step.
//!
//! This collapses that into [`plan`] and [`DocumentPlan::finish`]. What
//! is left in the caller is a choice of [`Format`] and a card.
//!
//! # The signature encoding
//!
//! [`DocumentPlan::finish`] takes the signature **exactly as the card
//! returned it**: PKCS#1 for RSA, and the raw `r || s` pair for ECDSA
//! (FINEID S1 v4.2 sec.3.8.3). Which encoding each format wants differs
//! -- CMS needs DER, XML needs the raw pair -- and converting is this
//! module's job, not the caller's. A caller signing with something that
//! already produces DER has to undo that first; see
//! [`crate::xades::ecdsa_signature_to_xml`].
