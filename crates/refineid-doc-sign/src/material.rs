//! Gather the certificates and revocation answers a level-LT signature
//! carries.
//!
//! [`refineid_lib_core::sign::validation`] defines the shape; this
//! fills it. Doing so means going to the network -- following the
//! authority information access extension up the chain, and asking each
//! issuer's responder whether the certificate below it is still good --
//! which is why it lives here and not in the core.
//!
//! # Why it is worth the round trips
//!
//! Everything collected here is available to a verifier today, over the
//! same URLs. The point is that it will not always be. A FINEID
//! certificate is valid for five years and the responder answering for
//! it is a service someone operates; when either goes, a signature
//! without this material becomes uncheckable. Collecting it at signing
//! time freezes the evidence while it is still there to freeze.
