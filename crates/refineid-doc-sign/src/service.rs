//! `refineid card sign-auth` + `refineid card sign-qualified`.
//!
//! SHA-256 the input file, VERIFY the appropriate PIN, drive the
//! SHA-256+RSA-PKCS1v15 sign chain against the chosen FINEID key
//! slot, write the raw 384-byte RSA signature to disk, and
//! locally verify it against the public key in the on-card cert.
//!
//! - `sign-auth`: VERIFY PIN1, sign with the **auth key** (key
//!   ref `0x01`), verify against the EF.4331 cert.
//! - `sign-qualified`: VERIFY PIN2, sign with the **qualified-
//!   signature key** (key ref `0x02`), verify against the
//!   EF.4332 cert. PIN2 has a 6-digit floor (FINEID S1 v4.2 §3.5).
//!
//! Both paths share the same option / report / error types and a
//! shared internal driver (`sign_with_slot`) so the wire
//! choreography stays in lockstep.
