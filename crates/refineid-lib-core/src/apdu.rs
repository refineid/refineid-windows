//! Shared APDU primitives.
//!
//! This module hosts the small set of types that every protocol
//! module needs when constructing or parsing ISO 7816-4 APDUs:
//! status words, class / instruction bytes, application
//! identifiers, short-file identifiers, and similar low-level
//! shapes.
//!
//! Protocol-specific APDU command structs (e.g. PACE's
//! `GeneralAuthenticate`, signature's `ComputeDigitalSignature`,
//! PKCS#15's `SelectFile` / `ReadBinary`) live next to their
//! drivers in those protocol modules (`pace::commands`,
//! `sign::commands`, `pkcs15::commands`). Each protocol owns its
//! own APDU shapes so a future re-shuffle of, say, the PACE
//! driver can take its APDUs with it.
//!
//! The split follows refineid-core's [refinement types] (no
//! untyped bytes across the card
//! boundary; every byte sequence has a protocol role and a
//! typed container).
//!
