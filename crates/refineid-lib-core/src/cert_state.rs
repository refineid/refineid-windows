//! Cert state lattice (typestate).
//!
//! Per FINEID S2 v5.2 §2: *"software products and network
//! services SHALL perform Basic Path Validation as described
//! in RFC 5280, §6.1"* and *"MUST always check
//! validity of certificate against valid CRL or OCSP service
//! before trusting a single certificate"*. The cert state
//! lattice in this module makes that spec mandate enforceable
//! by the compiler: a cert can only be used for a trust
//! decision after each stage has executed.
//!
//! Stages, in order:
//!
//! 1. [`RawDer`] -- byte sequence from the wire (PKCS#15 read,
//!    AIA fetch, file load). Nothing parsed.
//! 2. [`ParsedCert`] -- X.509 v3 syntax check passed, fields
//!    extractable. Signature has *not* been verified by anyone.
//! 3. [`PathValidatedCert`] -- RFC 5280 §6.1 Basic Path
//!    Validation passed. The cert chains to a pinned trust
//!    anchor. Signatures along the path are verified.
//! 4. [`RevocationCheckedCert`] -- the leaf and every
//!    intermediate has been confirmed not on a fresh CRL /
//!    OCSP response, both signature-verified.
//! 5. [`PurposeBoundCert<P>`] -- the cert's `KeyUsage` and
//!    `ExtendedKeyUsage` extensions bind it to the typed
//!    purpose `P` (one of [`AuthPurpose`], [`NonRepPurpose`],
//!    [`CscaPurpose`], [`DscPurpose`], [`MlsPurpose`]). A cert
//!    bound to `AuthPurpose` cannot be passed to a function
//!    expecting `NonRepPurpose`.
//!
//! Each stage is constructed only by a function that ran the
//! check. Skipping a stage is a compile error.
//!
//! The stages follow refineid-core's [refinement types] policy; the
//! certificate profile is DVV's FINEID S2.
//!
