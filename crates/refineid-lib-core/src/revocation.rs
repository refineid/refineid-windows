//! Revocation orchestration: tie a parsed [`crate::x509::Certificate`]
//! to a parsed [`crate::crl::Crl`] or [`crate::ocsp::OcspResponse`]
//! and surface a single [`RevocationStatus`].
//!
//! Scope is deliberately narrow:
//!
//! - **Signature verification is not done here.** Callers must
//!   verify the CRL / OCSP response signature against a trusted
//!   issuer cert *before* calling in. A bare-bones "look up the
//!   serial" path with no signature check is exactly how MITM
//!   attacks succeed; this module makes that contract explicit
//!   instead of pretending it doesn't exist.
//! - **Time-validity is checked relative to an
//!   [`crate::x509::DateTime`] supplied by the caller**, not via
//!   any system clock. lib-core stays I/O-free; the binding to
//!   `SystemTime` (or whatever clock the use case needs) lives
//!   one layer up.
//!
//! The module ships in full; the card-status subcommand that
//! consumes it is queued.
