//! The single OS-CSPRNG seam for this crate.
//!
//! Every random draw in `lib-core` goes through here so the fail-closed
//! policy lives in exactly one place: a failed OS RNG is always a hard
//! [`Failure`], propagated by the caller, never silently swallowed into a
//! weakened mode (a dropped nonce, a predictable IV). A dead OS RNG means
//! no cryptographic operation on this host can be trusted, so the only
//! correct response is to abort.
//!
//! Domain nonce / key types (the PACE / AA / CA ephemeral draws) build
//! on [`fill`] / [`array()`] rather than calling `getrandom` directly. Public review treats any direct `getrandom` call
//! outside this module as a fail-closed boundary violation, so a new call
//! site cannot reintroduce a "draw, swallow the error, continue" path --
//! the mistake this seam exists to make unrepresentable.

/// The OS CSPRNG was unavailable.
///
/// Re-exported from `getrandom` so callers keep storing the concrete cause;
/// this alias is the crate's one RNG error type.
pub type Failure = getrandom::Error;

/// Fill `buf` with OS CSPRNG bytes, or fail.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns [`Failure`] if the OS RNG is unavailable. Propagate it; never
/// proceed with a partially-filled or zero buffer.
#[inline]
pub fn fill(buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Failure> {
    getrandom::fill(buf)
}

/// Draw a fresh `N`-byte array from the OS CSPRNG, or fail.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns [`Failure`] if the OS RNG is unavailable.
#[inline]
pub fn array<const N: usize>() -> Result<[u8; N], Failure> {
    let mut bytes = [0_u8; N];
